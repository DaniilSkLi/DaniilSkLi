# I'm here now: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/DaniilSkLi)
## I advise you and van to switch from the proprietary, in the hands of Microsoft project GitHub to an open independent project, such as Codeberg that I chose, Notabug, Gitea and others :)

### My very old README :P

- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaniilSkLi
- 👀 I'm interested in creating everything of my own :) Be it a CMS system or a browser.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VUE.js more deeply, I only know it superficially. 
- 💞️ I am ready to cooperate with everyone who is interested in that :)
- 📫 You can write to me in telegram: @DaniilPublic or in instagram @daniil.skli
